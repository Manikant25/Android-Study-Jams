# TaskDivider-Android-App
This app is used to divide a particular task in subtask and assign it to others with priorities. This may be useful for team projects or collaborative work

## Problem Statement

In college many times students are involved in group projects either academically or on their own. In a software project there is a lot of idealism, bugs, crashes, new features etc. So it becomes a challenging and difficult to manage. When there are a lot tasks ,we have to manage it wisely according to their priority and divide the work. To ease these this android application is built, with initial features, more to be added soon.üîú

## Proposed Solution :

This project proposes a ‚ÄúTaskDiver App‚Äù, in which we can store all the subtask needed to accomplish a task or project. We can give title of the task, its priority and a small decription. There is an option to sort the task according to priority. For instance we have less time then we can sort all task according to its priority and do them first. Also we can search a particular task. This project needs to be extended more to become to usable and it could be used for variety of task, which may solve many problems of people.
